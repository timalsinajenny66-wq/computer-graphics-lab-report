Bresenham’s Line Drawing Algorithm
Bresenham’s line algorithm is an 
algorithm which determines which 
order to form a close approximation 
to a straight line between two given points. 
Write a C program for determining pixel activation
list between two given points in order to draw line 
segment using Bresenham’s line drawing algorithm.
Algorithm ;
1.Input the two line end-points, storing the left end-point in (x₀, y₀).
2.Plot the point (x₀, y₀).
3.Calculate the constants Δx, Δy, 2Δy, and (2Δy − 2Δx) and get the first value for the decision parameter as:
   p₀ = 2Δy − Δx
    At each xₖ along the line, starting at k = 0, perform the following test:
4.If pₖ < 0, the next point to plot is (xₖ + 1, yₖ) and
   pₖ₊₁ = pₖ + 2Δy
   Otherwise, the next point to plot is (xₖ + 1, yₖ + 1) and
    pₖ₊₁ = pₖ + 2Δy − 2Δx
5.Repeat step 4 (Δx − 1) times.
