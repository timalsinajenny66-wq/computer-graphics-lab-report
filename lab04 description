The Midpoint Circle Generation Algorithm
is an efficient rasterization technique
used in computer graphics to draw a 
circle on a pixel-based display.
It determines the positions of pixels 
that best approximate a circle by 
using only integer arithmetic, 
which makes it faster than methods 
based on trigonometric or floating-point
calculations.The algorithm works by evaluating 
the midpoint between two possible pixels at each
step and deciding which pixel is closer to the actual circle.
ALGORITHM:
1. Input center coordinates � and radius �.
Step 2:
       Initialize:
Step 3:
       Plot the initial eight symmetric points using:
Step 4:
         While , repeat:
Increment 
If :
p = p + 2x - 2y + 1 
Step 5:
For each calculated point, plot all eight symmetric points.
Step 6:
Stop when.
